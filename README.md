# squashfs

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/rclone/squashfs)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rclone/squashfs) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/rclone/squashfs)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/rclone/squashfs)

A PURE Go library to read squashfs. There is currently no plans to add archive creation support as it will almost always be better to just call `mksquashfs`. I could see some possible use cases, but probably won't spend time on it unless it's requested (open a discussion fi you want this feature).

Currently has support for reading squashfs files and extracting files and folders.

Special thanks to <https://dr-emann.github.io/squashfs/> for some VERY important information in an easy to understand format.
Thanks also to [distri's squashfs library](https://github.com/distr1/distri/tree/master/internal/squashfs) as I referenced it to figure some things out (and double check others).

## [TODO](https://github.com/rclone/squashfs/projects/1?fullscreen=true)

## Limitations

* No Xattr parsing. This is simply because I haven't done any research on it and how to apply these in a pure go way.
* Socket files are not extracted.
  * From my research, it seems like a socket file would be useless if it could be created.
* Fifo files are ignored on `darwin`

## Issues

* Significantly slower then `unsquashfs` when extracting folders (about 5 ~ 7 times slower on a ~100MB archive using zstd compression)
  * This seems to be related to above along with the general optimization of `unsquashfs` and it's compression libraries.
  * The larger the file's tree, the slower the extraction will be. Arch Linux's Live USB's airootfs.sfs takes ~35x longer for a full extraction.

## Recommendations on Usage

Due to the above performance consideration, this library should only be used to access files within the archive without extraction, or to mount it via Fuse.

* Neither of these use cases are largely effected by the issue above.
